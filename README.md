When You Follow Someone On Twitter, That User's Tweets Appear In Your Timeline And, If You Want To Remove Them From Your Timeline, You Must Unfollow Them. If You Have Multiple Users That You Wish To Unfollow, This Means Seeking Out Each User Individually And Clicking The "Unfollow" Button Next To Their Username. This Method Eliminates This Issue By Letting You Mass Unfollow Twitter Users That You No Longer Want To Follow Without Having To Download Anything.
